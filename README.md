# Application Setup Guide

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Node.js (>= 12.0.0)
- npm (or yarn, if preferred)
 

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

Or if you prefer yarn:

```bash
yarn
```

## Step 2: Start Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local development server at `http://localhost:5173`. You can now start building your application.
